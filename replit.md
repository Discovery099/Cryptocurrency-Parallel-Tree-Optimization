## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture with the following key design decisions:

- **Component Library**: Uses shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for consistent, accessible UI components
- **State Management**: Implements React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management with real-time data fetching and caching
- **Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme optimized for cryptocurrency mining interfaces
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data streaming and system notifications
- **Charts and Visualization**: Recharts library for performance monitoring and analytics dashboards

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a service-oriented architecture with Express.js and TypeScript:

- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **Service Layer**: Modular services for different domain areas (GPU management, mining pools, Merkle tree optimization, analytics)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for broadcasting live updates to connected clients
- **Background Processing**: Scheduled tasks for metrics collection, alert processing, and system monitoring
- **Middleware**: Request validation, error handling, and logging middleware

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless database)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema-first approach and automatic migrations
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with @neondatabase/serverless
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive schemas for users, GPUs, mining pools, Merkle tree configurations, system metrics, alerts, and transaction batches

### Core Mining Engine Components
The system implements sophisticated mining optimization algorithms:

- **Adaptive Merkle Tree Service**: Dynamic parallel tree construction with configurable threading and caching strategies
- **GPU Management**: Real-time monitoring of GPU performance, temperature, power consumption, and optimization
- **Mining Pool Integration**: Support for multiple mining pools with automatic failover and load balancing
- **Analytics Engine**: Performance tracking, efficiency calculations, and predictive analytics

### Authentication and Authorization
Basic authentication system with role-based access control:

- **User Management**: User registration and authentication with password hashing
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with database storage
- **Role-based Access**: Admin and user roles with different permission levels
