## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `cryptocurrency-parallel-tree-optimization`
3. Description: `Cryptocurrency parallel Merkle tree optimization with GPU acceleration, ML optimization, and quantum-resistant algorithms`
4. Public repository
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we have our own)

### Step 2: Upload Files
Since git operations are restricted, upload manually:

1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Select ALL files from this Replit project
3. Commit message: `Initial commit: Production-ready cryptocurrency parallel tree optimization platform`

### Step 3: Repository Configuration
1. **Settings → General**
   - Add topics: `cryptocurrency`, `mining`, `merkle-tree`, `gpu-acceleration`, `machine-learning`, `parallel-computing`, `blockchain`, `react`, `typescript`
   - Enable issues and wiki

2. **Settings → Pages** (Optional)
   - Enable GitHub Pages for documentation hosting

### Step 4: Create Release
1. Go to "Releases" → "Create a new release"
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: `Initial Release - Cryptocurrency Parallel Tree Optimization`
4. Description: (See GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md for full description)
